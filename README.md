## About Summon Corpses Power

Adds a power that summons a coffin once a day to dump 1 to 25 fresh corpses on the targeted area. The number of corpses is based on your Conjuration skill.

You may be wondering why this mod exists. It was an idea I had while working on another silly mod. I made this only because I thought it was interesting. Maybe this is useful for a Necromancer play-through? I don't know; I didn't make it with any purpose in mind other than thinking it would be cool in a macabre sort of way.

## Features

### The Summon Corpses Power

The "Summon Corpses" power can be used once a day. It will summon a coffin above the targeted area and dump 1-25 corpses.

The power can be learned through a spell tome in the Whiterun Hall of the Dead Catacombs.

The corpses can be looted, reanimated, or just left for decoration.

### Number of Corpses

The number corpses summoned scales with your Conjuration skill.

* Skill level 1-19: 1 corpse
* Skill level 20-29: 5 corpses
* Skill level 30-39: 10 corpses
* Skill level 40-49: 15 corpses
* Skill level 50-59: 20 corpses
* Skill level 60+: 25 corpses

### Types of Corpses

The types of corpses summoned are random but can be bandits, warlocks, Forsworn, Guards, Imperial soldiers, Stormcloak soldiers, Thalmor, and vampires.

The level of corpses scales with your player level.

## User Guide

## Compatibility

This mod should be compatible with everything. Any mod that significantly modifies the Hall of the Dead Catacombs in Whiterun may make the spell tome inaccessible.
